        <p>If the draft does not already feature a multi-items kit, the user goes straight to: </p>

        <p class="indent">The first page of the nanomaterials task (journey). <br>This nanomaterial is then automatically associated with the single product.</p>

        <p>Else</p>

        <p class="indent">The user is served a new HTML page: via check boxes we ask which items (shown in a list) include the nanomaterial you are adding?<br>'Continue' then takes the user straight to the first page of the nanomaterials task (journey).</p>

        <hr>

        <p>When returning to the draft page after completeing the nanomaterial task/journey, the new nanomaterial is shown appended to the nanomaterials list (with a completed status). The list remains in its original order.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 50px;"><small>The <u>Add</u> link is only available if nanomaterials have already been featured - so 'rinse off' and 'exposure' questions are already set for all nanomaterials.</small></p>
