        <p>The user completes this task, which includes providing a name<sup>*</sup> - for the item in the multi-item kit - and follows the &quot;Complete Product&quot;/Categorise task journey.</p>



        <ul>
            <li>At the end of the Categorise task journey the user has the option to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Continue directly onto the next item (if there is one)</li>
                    <li>Or <a href="draft-3_pt-5a.html">return</a> to the drafts page</li>
                </ol>

            </li>
            <li>When following the items task journey, we add the item title to the H1 title of each page (starting with its holding title)</li>
            <li>When returning to the draft page, the corresponding task in the 'Category and formation' section has updated its name. (The two are linked). The first item link demonstrates this.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><sup>*</sup> The "what is the item's name" page only appears at the start of the Complete items journey if the status of the product is a multi-item kit. Otherwise the new 'Select the nanomaterials' page is the starting page of the task.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>For this click-through demo we assume that all 'Multi-item details' tasks have been completed.</p>
        <p>After completing the task the user <a href="draft-3_pt-5b.html">returns</a> to the drafts page.</p>
