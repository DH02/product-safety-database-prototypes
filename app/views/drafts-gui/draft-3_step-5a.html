        <p>The user completes this task, which includes providing a name - for the item in the multi-item kit - and follows the &quot;Complete Product&quot;/Categorise task journey.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>At the end of the Categorise task journey the user has the option to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Continue directly onto the next item (if there is one)</li>
                    <li>Or <a href="draft-3_pt-5a.html">return</a> to the drafts page</li>
                </ol>

            </li>
            <li>When following the items task journey, we add the item title to the H1 title of each page (starting with its holding title)</li>
            <li>When returning to the draft page, the corresponding task in the 'Category and formation' section has updated its name. (The two are linked).</li>
        </ul>
